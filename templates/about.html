<h3>About</h3>

    <p>This website was created primarily to showcase my interest in finance, machine learning and web development. </P>
      <p>In finance there is a phenomenon called post earnings announcement drift.
        In this phenomenon stock prices drift in either a negative or positive direction respective to each companies cummulative abnormal returns.
        This is a well documented and proven theory that is both economically and statistically viable.
        This drift can occur for days or even months after the announcement. In the model a 10 day holding period is used. An example of this drift tendency is shown below. </p>

      <P>In machine learning we train a computer generated model using known information about price movements, and then ask the model to predict price movements given new information.

        I've created a machine learning algorithm that has successfully classified companies and their price movements based
         on previous and current earnings announcements, amongst other relavent funamental information. This model has shown considerable outperformance in the market over the last three years and is likely to continue.</p>

      <P> See the dashboard to see performance, or sign up to be alerted when a new positve prediction is made.  </p>
